# Materials
One stop references shop. There is a lot more where this came from. This repo is a quick illustration that I have code to hand and have worked with zipline on custom bundles

## Folder Contents:

### 1.AboutMe
Short resume, some relevant news articles

### 2.DataChecksDemo
Elementary demo of a script that I used to do high-level data checks on a fundamental dataset

### 3.ZiplineDemo - Research Environment
 1. Local implementation of https://github.com/jamesdellinger/ai_for_trading_nanodegree_alpha_research_multi_factor_modeling_project using own bundle and own custom functions. The aim of the game was to get a cross-sectional 5-day reversal strategy to run on the JSE. The finding from the full backtest was that txn costs kill the strat.
 2. Local implementation of feature engineering from the same course as above, some factors were mine

### 3.ZiplineDemo - Backtest
 Can't remember which backtest this was, it's from 7 months ago, but just an illustration of a backtest on a custom bundle

### 4.MiscDemo
Statistical Risk Model Class

Webscraping script that scrapes "https://www.sharenet.co.za/v3/sens.php". I have set it to combine into output, a pd dataframe, but this script is actually part of a bigger system that updates a SQLite database
